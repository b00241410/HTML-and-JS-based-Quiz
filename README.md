# HTML-and-JS-based-Quiz
Project Description:

This is a web-based quiz game inspired by the iconic ITV show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? created by Kenneth Munro. Designed as a work-in-progress tribute, the game recreates the exciting atmosphere of WWTBAM by challenging players with a series of progressively harder multiple-choice questions. Each correct answer increases the player's virtual winnings, just like in the real show!

Key features include:

A prize ladder, displaying your current winnings after each question.

Classic lifelines: "Phone a Friend" ðŸ“ž, "50:50" (removes two wrong answers), and "Ask the Audience" ðŸ‘¥ â€” all authentically recreated.

A dramatic background with smooth color transitions to reflect the tension of climbing toward Â£1,000,000.

Confirmation prompts before locking in your final answer, adding a layer of suspense true to the show's original format.

A flashing end message when you either win big or get a question wrong.

This project captures the heart of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? â€” mixing knowledge, strategy, and a little bit of luck.
